# boot.dev go pokédex project with [pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co)

You can:
- list the available maps with `map` (forward) and `mapb` (backwards) (20 maps per page)
- get some details of a map through the `explore <map-name>` command
- "catch" pokémons with the `catch <pokemon-name>` command
- you can inspect information on caught pokémons through the `inspect <pokemon-name>` command
- print the help text with `help`
- exit with `exit`

This repo is not going to be updated, but I might try to rewrite this project by improving the project structure and the way the JSON data is parsed (and eventually the cache as well)
